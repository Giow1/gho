= gh

A simple multi-platform cli utility written in Rust that opens your browser in your project's repo on gitlab or github.

While a bash script like the following could work, that will not work on Windows:
```
gh ()
{
    ( set -e;
    git remote -v | grep push;
    remote=${1:-origin};
    echo "Using remote $remote";
    URL=$(git config remote.$remote.url | sed "s/git@\(.*\):\(.*\).git/https:\/\/\1\/\2/");
    echo "Opening $URL...";
    open $URL )
}
```

`gh` on the other hand, should work fine (testers and feedback are welcome).

The url is fetched on your remotes.

== Install

    cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/chevdor/gh --tag v0.2.0

== Usage

- `gh` to simply open the first remote
- `gh upstream` to open your `upstream` remote
